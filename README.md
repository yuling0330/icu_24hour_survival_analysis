# icu_24hour_survival_analysis

## Background

**Industry Overview**: 

MIT's GOSSIS community initiative is seeking an efficient way to address the problems with existing severity of illness systems: 
They often lack generalizability beyond the patients on whom the models were developed, and
The models are often proprietary, costly to use (APACHE scoring system…), and suffer from opaque algorithms. 


----
### Objective:

Create a model that uses data from the first 24 hours of intensive care to predict patient survival with:  Better prediction probability of death (as compared to apache_4a_icu_prob, apache_4a_hospital_prob)
  - Minimize apache features 
  - Transparent (easy to explain)
  - Generalizability
  - Less complexity
